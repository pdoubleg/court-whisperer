Verizon Internet Services, Inc., 359 U.S. App. D.C. 85 (D.C. Cir. 2003) | available at  *88 See  Indirect Liability for Copyright Infringement: An Economic Perspective,  See Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.,  259 F.Supp.2d 1029 The RIAA now has begun to direct its anti-infringement efforts against individual users of P2P file sharing programs. In order to pursue apparent infringers the RIAA needs to be able to identify the individuals who are sharing and trading files using P2P programs. The RIAA can readily obtain the screen name of an individual user, and using the Internet Protocol (IP) address associated with that screen name, can trace the user to his ISP. Only the ISP, however, can link the IP address used to access a P2P program with the name and address of a person - the ISP’s customer - who can then be contacted or, if need be, sued by the RIAA. The RIAA has used the subpoena provisions of § 512(h) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) to compel ISPs to disclose the names of subscribers whom the RIAA has reason to believe are infringing its members’ copyrights.  See  17 U.S.C. § 512 (h)(1) (copyright owner may “request the clerk of any United States district court to issue a subpoena to [an ISP] for identification of an alleged infringer”). Some ISPs have complied with the RIAA’s § 512(h) subpoenas and identified the names of the subscribers sought by the RIAA.

Grokster, Ltd.,  259 F.Supp.2d 1029 The RIAA now has begun to direct its anti-infringement efforts against individual users of P2P file sharing programs. In order to pursue apparent infringers the RIAA needs to be able to identify the individuals who are sharing and trading-files using P2P programs. The RIAA can readily obtain the screen name of an individual user, and using the Internet Protocol (IP) address associated with that screen name, can trace the user to his ISP. Only the ISP, however, can link the IP address used to access a P2P program with the name and address of a person - the ISP’s customer - who can then be contacted or, if need be, sued by the RIAA. The RIAA has used the subpoena provisions of § 512(h) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) to compel ISPs to disclose the names of subscribers whom the RIAA has reason to believe are infringing its members’ copyrights.  See  17 U.S.C. § 512 (h)(1) (copyright owner may “request the clerk of any United States district court to issue a subpoena to [an ISP] for identification of an alleged in-fringer”). Some ISPs have complied with the RIAA’s § 512(h) subpoenas and identified the names of the subscribers sought by the RIAA. The RIAA has sent letters to and filed lawsuits against several hundred such individuals, each of whom allegedly made available for download by other users hundreds or in some cases even thousands of .mp3 files of copyrighted recordings.

Network Prods., Inc.,  902 F.2d 829 Sinnott first contends that actual “knowledge of specific instances of infringement” are required to satisfy the “knowledge” prong of contributory liability. Opp’n, at 20. In making this argument, Sinnott relies on  Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.,  259 F.Supp.2d 1029  (C.D.Cal.2003). But  Grok-ster  does not compel this finding in Sin-nott’s case. The question in  Grokster  was more about when the defendants had knowledge rather than what knowledge they possessed. For it is only if the defendant has knowledge of the direct infringement at the time it materially contributes to the direct infringement that secondary liability can be found. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.,  259 F.Supp.2d 1029 Grok-ster  Grokster  In  Grokster,  the court found that the defendants were not liable because they only provided the software that allowed others to share music, but none of the actual sharing involved the defendants directly.  259 F.Supp.2d at 1039-40 . Thus, the defendants claimed, and the court agreed, that they were much more like the VCR makers in  Sony  than Napster because the file sharing users of Napster relied on Napster for the connection between them. Grokster, however, provided the software and then the file sharing users communicated without Grokster’s assistance, much like the VCR makers in  Sony  merely provided the VCR and the users did the rest.

This appeal is the latest reprise of that recurring conflict, and one of a continuing series of lawsuits between the recording industry and distributors of file-sharing computer software. The plaintiffs in the consolidated cases (“Copyright Owners”) are songwriters, music publishers, and motion picture studios who, by their own description, “own or control the vast majority of copyrighted motion pictures and sound recordings in the United States.” 1  Defendants Grokster Ltd. and StreamCast Networks, Inc. (“Software Distributors”) are companies that freely distribute software that allows users to share computer files with each other, including digitized music and motion pictures. The Copyright Owners allege that over 90% of the files exchanged through use of the “peer-to-peer” file-sharing software offered by the Software Distributors involves copyrighted material, 70% of which is owned by the Copyright Owners. Thus, the Copyright Owners argue, the Software Distributors are liable for vicarious and contributory copyright infringement pursuant to  17 U.S.C. §§ 501-13  (2000), for which the Copyright Owners are entitled to monetary and in-junctive relief. The district court granted the Software Distributors partial summary judgment as to liability arising from present activities and certified the resolved questions for appeal pursuant to Fed.

Grokster, Ltd.,  259 F.Supp.2d 1029 (“Grokster I”). To analyze the legal issues properly, a rudimentary under-standing of the peer-to-peer file-sharing software at issue is required — particularly because peer-to-peer file sharing differs from typical internet use. In a routine internet transaction, a user will connect via the internet with a website to obtain information or transact business. In computer terms, the personal computer used by the consumer is considered the “client” and the computer that hosts the web page is the “server.” The client is obtaining information from a centralized source, namely the server. In a peer-to-peer distribution network, the information available for access does not reside on a central server. No one computer contains all of the information that is available to all of the users. Rather, each computer makes information available to every other computer in the peer-to-peer network. In other words, in a peer-to-peer network, each computer is both a server and a client. Because the information is decentralized in a peer-to-peer network, the software must provide some method of cataloguing the available information so that users may access it. The software operates by connecting, via the internet, to other users of the same or similar software. At any given moment, the network consists of other users of similar or the same software online at that time. Thus, an index of files available for sharing is a critical component of peer-to-peer file-sharing networks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",

If the product at issue is not capable of substantial or commercially significant noninfringing uses, then the copyright owner need only show that the defendant had constructive knowledge of the infringement. On the other hand, if the product at issue  is  capable of substantial or commercially significant noninfringing uses, then the copyright owner must demonstrate that the defendant had reasonable knowledge of specific infringing files and failed to act on that knowledge to prevent infringement.  See Napster I,  239 F.3d at 1027. is  See Napster I,   In this case, the district court found it undisputed that the software distributed by each defendant was capable of substantial noninfringing uses.  Grokster I,  259 F.Supp.2d at 1035 . A careful examination of the record indicates that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to noninfringing use. Indeed, the Software Distributors submitted numerous declarations by persons who permit their work to be distributed via the software, or who use the software to distribute public domain works.  See  id.   One striking example provided by the Software Distributors is the popular band Wilco, whose record company had declined to release one of its albums on the basis that it had no commercial potential. Wilco repurchased the work from the record company and made the album available for free downloading, both from its own website and through the software user networks. The result sparked widespread interest and, as a result, Wilco received another recording contract. Other recording artists have debuted their works through the user networks. Indeed, the record indicates that thousands of other musical groups have authorized free distribution of their music through the internet.

Grokster I,  259 F.Supp.2d at 1035 . A careful examination of the record indicates that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to noninfringing use. Indeed, the Software Distributors submitted numerous declarations by persons who permit their work to be distributed via the software, or who use the software to distribute public domain works.  See  id.   One striking example provided by the Software Distributors is the popular band Wilco, whose record company had declined to release one of its albums on the basis that it had no commercial potential. Wilco repurchased the work from the record company and made the album available for free downloading, both from its own website and through the software user networks. The result sparked widespread interest and, as a result, Wilco received another recording contract. Other recording artists have debuted their works through the user networks. Indeed, the record indicates that thousands of other musical groups have authorized free distribution of their music through the internet.

Grokster I,  259 F.Supp.2d at 1035 See  id.   id. *1162 Sony-Betamax  The Copyright Owners submitted no evidence that could contradict these declarations. Rather, the Copyright Owners argue that the evidence establishes that the vast majority of the software use is for copyright infringement. This argument misapprehends the  Sony  standard as construed in  Napster I,  which emphasized that in order for limitations imposed by  Sony  to apply, a product need only be  capable  of substantial noninfringing uses.

As the district court correctly concluded, the time at which such knowledge is obtained is significant. Because contributory copyright infringement requires knowledge  and  material contribution, the Copyright Owners were required to establish that the Software Distributors had “specific knowledge of infringement at a time at which they contribute^] to the infringement, and [] fail[ed] to act upon that information.”  Grokster I,  259 F.Supp.2d at  1036 (citing  Napster I,  239 F.3d at 1021). As the district court correctly observed, and as we explain further in our discussion of material contribution, “Plaintiffs’ notices of infringing conduct are irrelevant,” because “they arrive when Defendants do nothing to facilitate, and cannot do anything to stop, the alleged infringement” of specific copyrighted content.

As we have discussed, the software at issue in  Napster I  and  Napster II  employed a centralized set of servers that maintained an index of available files. In contrast, under both StreamCast’s decentralized, Gnutellatype network and Grokster’s quasi-decentralized, supernode, KaZaa-type network, no central index is maintained. Indeed, at present, neither StreamCast nor Grokster maintains control over index files. As the district court observed, even if the Software Distributors “closed their doors and deactivated all computers within their control, users of their products could continue sharing files with little or no interruption.”  Grokster I,  259 F.Supp.2d at 1041 .

Cherry Auction, Inc.,  76 F.3d 259 As indicated by the record, the Software Distributors do not provide the “site and facilities” for infringement, and do not otherwise materially contribute to direct infringement. Infringing messages or file indices do not reside on defendants’ computers, nor do defendants have the ability to suspend user accounts.  Grokster I,  259 F.Supp.2d at 1037, 1039-41 . Grokster I,  259 F.Supp.2d at 1037, 1039-41 While material contribution can be established through provision of site and facilities for infringement, followed by a failure to stop specific instances of infringement once knowledge of those infringements is acquired, the Software Distributors have not provided the site and facilities for infringement in the first place. If the Software Distributors were true access providers, failure to disable that access after acquiring specific knowledge of a user’s infringement might be material contribution.  Netcom,  907 F.Supp. at 1375 . Or, if the Software Distributors stored files or indices, failure to delete the offending files or offending index listings might be material contribution.  Napster I,  239 F.3d at 1022. However, the Software Distributors here are not access providers, and they do not provide file storage and index maintenance. Rather, it is the users of the software who, by connecting to each other over the internet, create the network and provide the access. “Failure” to alter software located on another’s computer is simply not akin to the failure to delete a filename from one’s own computer, to the failure to cancel the registration name and password of a particular user from one’s user  *1164 list, or to the failure to make modifications to software on one’s own computer.

Stream-Cast maintains an XML  11  file from which user software periodically retrieves parameters. These values may include the addresses of websites where lists of active users are maintained. The owner of the FastTrack software, Sharman, maintains root nodes containing lists of currently active supernodes to which users can connect. Both defendants also communicate with users incidentally, but not to facilitate infringement. All of these activities are too incidental to any direct copyright infringement to constitute material contribution. No infringing files or lists of infringing files are hosted by defendants, and the defendants do not regulate or provide access. 11 While Grokster and StreamCast in particular may seek to be the “next Napster,”  Grokster I,  259 F.Supp.2d at 1036 , the peer-to-peer file-sharing technology at issue is not simply a tool engineered to get around the holdings of  Napster I  and  Napster II.  The technology has numerous other uses, significantly reducing the distribution costs of public domain and permissively shared art and speech, as well as reducing the centralized control of that distribution. Especially in light of the fact that liability for contributory copyright infringement does not require proof of any direct financial gain from the infringement, we decline to expand contributory copyright liability in the manner that the Copyright Owners request.

       "|         9117679 | Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., 259 F. Supp. 2d 1029 (C.D. Cal. 2003) |          9214758 | Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, Inc. v. Grokster Ltd., 380 F.3d 1154 (9th Cir. 2004)                                    | See Napster I,  Cherry Auction,  76 F.3d at 261-62 The district court here found that unlike Napster, Grokster and StreamCast do not operate and design an “integrated service,”  Grokster I,  259 F.Supp.2d at 1045 , which they monitor and control. We agree. The nature of the relationship between Grokster and StreamCast and their users is significantly different from the nature of the relationship between a swap meet operator and its participants, or prior versions of Napster and its users, since Grokster and StreamCast are more truly decentralized, peer-to-peer file-sharing networks. Grokster I,  259 F.Supp.2d at 1045 The district court correctly characterized the Copyright Owners’ evidence of the right and ability to supervise as little more than a contention that “the software  *1166 itself could be altered to prevent users from sharing copyrighted files.”  Grokster I,  259 F.Supp.2d at 1045 . In arguing that this ability constitutes evidence of the right and ability to supervise, the Copyright Owners confuse the right and ability to supervise with the strong duty imposed on entities that have already been determined to be liable for vicarious copyright infringement; such entities have an obligation to exercise their policing powers to the fullest extent, which in Napster’s case included implementation of new filtering mechanisms.  Napster II,  284 F.3d at 1098  (“The tolerance standard announced  applies only to copyrighted works which Plaintiffs have properly noticed  as required by the modified preliminary injunction. That is, Napster must do everything feasible to block files from its system which contain noticed copyrighted works.”) (emphasis added). But the potential duty a district court may place on a vicariously liable defendant is not the same as the “ability” contemplated by the “right and ability to supervise” test.

Grokster Ltd., 380 F.3d 1154 (9th Cir. 2004)                                    | Grokster I,  259 F.Supp.2d at 1045 The district court correctly characterized the Copyright Owners’ evidence of the right and ability to supervise as little more than a contention that “the software  *1166 itself could be altered to prevent users from sharing copyrighted files.”  Grokster I,  259 F.Supp.2d at 1045 . In arguing that this ability constitutes evidence of the right and ability to supervise, the Copyright Owners confuse the right and ability to supervise with the strong duty imposed on entities that have already been determined to be liable for vicarious copyright infringement; such entities have an obligation to exercise their policing powers to the fullest extent, which in Napster’s case included implementation of new filtering mechanisms.  Napster II,  284 F.3d at 1098  (“The tolerance standard announced  applies only to copyrighted works which Plaintiffs have properly noticed  as required by the modified preliminary injunction. That is, Napster must do everything feasible to block files from its system which contain noticed copyrighted works.”) (emphasis added). But the potential duty a district court may place on a vicariously liable defendant is not the same as the “ability” contemplated by the “right and ability to supervise” test. Moreover, a duty to alter software and files located on one’s own computer system is quite different in kind from a duty to alter software located on another person’s computer. We agree with the district court that possibilities for upgrading software located on another person’s computer are irrelevant to determining whether vicarious liability exists.

Turning a “Blind Eye” to Infringement The Copyright Owners finally argue that Grokster and StreamCast should not be able to escape vicarious liability by turning a “blind eye” to the infringement of their users, and that “[t]urning a blind eye to detectable acts of infringement for the sake of profit gives rise to liability.”  Napster I,  239 F.3d at 1023. If the Software Distributors had a right and ability to control and supervise that they proactively refused to exercise, such refusal would not absolve them of liability.  See id.  However, although that rhetoric has occasionally been employed in describing vicarious copyright infringement, there is no separate “blind eye” theory or element of vicarious liability that exists independently of the traditional elements of liability. Thus, this theory is subsumed into the Copyright Owners’ claim for vicarious copyright infringement and necessarily fails for the same reasons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",

Supp. 2d 411 (D.N.J. 2005)                                          | (July 12, 2004 Opinion at 18-19.) Columbus Farmers Market argues that this defense was improperly struck, because it seeks not to establish the “negligence of third parties” nor a claim for contribution, but rather to establish that any damage to Plaintiffs was the result of the actions of third parties, all of whom Columbus Farmers Market has no knowledge of, authority or control over. This argument essentially repeats that which Defendants made in briefing the initial motion (again, without any citation to law) and which this Court rejected. Third party direct liability is one of the elements of an allegation of secondary liability.  A & M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc.,  239 F.3d 1004 , 1013 n. 2 (9th Cir.2001); .  Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.,  259 F.Supp.2d 1029 , 1034 (C.D.Cal.2003). Thus, every case of contributory or vicarious liability necessarily involves the defendant being held to answer for the direct conduct of another. Moreover, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants are legally responsible for the infringement of these third parties (i.e. the vendors) because they had knowledge of and materially contributed to the third party’s infringing activity (contributory infringement), or had the ability to supervise and control it and financially benefited from it (vicarious liability). Plaintiffs need not sue the numerous third party direct infringers in order to bring this cause of action against Defendants.  In re Aimster Copyright Litigation,  334 F.3d 643 , 646 (7th Cir.2003).

Grokster, Ltd., 545 U.S. 913 (U.S. 2005)                                         | id.,  id.,  B After discovery, the parties on each side of the case cross-moved for summary judgment. The District Court limited its consideration to the asserted liability of Grokster and StreamCast for distributing the current versions of their software, leaving aside whether either was liable “for damages arising from  past  versions of their software, or from other past activities.”  259 F. Supp. 2d 1029 , 1038 (CD Cal. 2003). The District Court held that those who used the Grokster and Morpheus software to download copyrighted media files directly infringed MGM’s copyrights, a conclusion not contested on appeal, but the court nonetheless granted summary judgment in favor of Grokster and StreamCast as to any liability arising from distribution of the then-current versions of their software. Distributing that software gave rise to no liability in the court’s view, because its use did not provide the distributors with actual knowledge of specific acts of infringement. Case No. CV 01 08541 SVW (PJWx) (CD Cal., June 18, 2003), App. 1213. past  259 F. Supp. 2d 1029 The Court of Appeals affirmed.  380 F. 3d 1154  (CA9 2004). In the court’s analysis, a defendant was liable as a contributory infringer when it had knowledge of direct infringement and materially contributed to the infringement. But the court read  Sony Corp. of America  v.  Universal City Studios, Inc.,  464 U. S. 417  (1984), as holding that distribution of a commercial product capable of substantial nonin-fringing uses could not give rise to contributory liability for infringement unless the distributor had actual knowledge of specific instances of infringement and failed to act on that knowledge. The fact that the software was capable of substantial noninfringing uses in the Ninth Circuit’s view meant  *928 that Grokster and StreamCast were not liable, because they had no such actual knowledge, owing to the decentralized architecture of their software. The court also held that Grokster and StreamCast did not materially contribute to their users’ infringement because it was the users themselves who searched for, retrieved, and stored the infringing files, with no involvement by the defendants beyond providing the software in the first place. 380 F. 3d 1154 Sony Corp. of America  Universal City Studios, Inc.,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | NO                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n",

Supp. 2d, at 1035 . This conclusion appears to rest almost entirely on the collection of declarations submitted by Grok-ster and StreamCast.  Ibid.   Review of these declarations reveals mostly anecdotal evidence, sometimes obtained secondhand, of authorized copyrighted works or public domain works available online and shared through peer-to-peer networks, and general statements about the benefits of peer-to-peer technology.

Hoekman ¶¶3-4,  id.,  at 169-170 (search on Morpheus for “President Bush speeches” found several video recordings, searches for “Declaration of Independence” and “Bible” found various documents and declarant was able to download a copy of the Declaration); Decl. of Sean L. Mayers ¶ 11,  id.,  at 67 (“Existing open, decentralized peer-to-peer file-sharing networks ... offer content owners distinct business advantages over alternate online distribution technologies.”). Compare Decl. of Brewster Kahle ¶ 20,  id.,  at 142 (“Those who download the Prelinger films . . . are entitled to redistribute those files, and the Archive welcomes their redistribution by the Morpheus-Grokster-KaZaa community of users.”), with Deposition of Brewster Kahle (Sept. 18,  *947 2002),  id.,  at 396-403 (testifying that he has no knowledge of any person downloading a Prelinger film using Morpheus, Grokster, or KaZaA).

What is your understanding of Grokster? A. I have no understanding of Grokster. ... Q. Do you know whether any user of the Grokster software has made available to share any Prelinger film? A. No.”). See also Deposition of Aram Sinnreich (Sept. 25,2002),  id.,  at 390 (testimony about the band Wilco based on “[t]he press and industry news groups and scuttlebutt.”).

Supp. 2d, at 1035 . This conclusion appears to rest almost entirely on the collection of declarations submitted by Grok-ster and StreamCast.  Ibid.   Review of these declarations reveals mostly anecdotal evidence, sometimes obtained secondhand, of authorized copyrighted works or public domain works available online and shared through peer-to-peer networks, and general statements about the benefits of peer-to-peer technology. See,  e. g.,  Decl. of Janis Ian ¶ 13, App. 128 (“P2P technologies offer musicians an alternative channel for promotion and distribution.”); Decl. of Gregory Newby ¶ 12,  id.,  at 136 (“Numerous authorized and public domain Project Gutenberg eBooks are made available on Morpheus, Kazaa, Gnutella, Grokster, and similar software products.”); Decl. of Aram Sinnreich ¶6,  id.,  at 151 (“file sharing seems to have a net positive impact on music sales”); Decl. of John Busher ¶ 8,  id.,  at 166 (“I estimate that Acous-tica generates sales of between $1,000 and $10,000 per month as a result of the distribution of its trialware software through the Gnutella and FastTrack Networks.”); Decl. of Patricia D. Hoekman ¶¶3-4,  id.,  at 169-170 (search on Morpheus for “President Bush speeches” found several video recordings, searches for “Declaration of Independence” and “Bible” found various documents and declarant was able to download a copy of the Declaration); Decl. of Sean L. Mayers ¶ 11,  id.,  at 67 (“Existing open, decentralized peer-to-peer file-sharing networks ... offer content owners distinct business advantages over alternate online distribution technologies.”). Compare Decl. of Brewster Kahle ¶ 20,  id.,  at 142 (“Those who download the Prelinger films . . . are entitled to redistribute those files, and the Archive welcomes their redistribution by the Morpheus-Grokster-KaZaa community of users.”), with Deposition of Brewster Kahle (Sept. 18,  *947 2002),  id.,  at 396-403 (testifying that he has no knowledge of any person downloading a Prelinger film using Morpheus, Grokster, or KaZaA). Compare also Decl. of Richard Prelin-ger ¶ 17,  id.,  at 147 (“[W]e welcome further redistribution of the Prelinger films ... by individuals using peer-to-peer software products like Morpheus, KaZaA and Grokster.”)) with Deposition of Richard Prelinger (Oct. 1, 2002),  id.,  at 410-411 (“Q. What is your understanding of Grokster? A. I have no understanding of Grokster. ... Q. Do you know whether any user of the Grokster software has made available to share any Prelinger film? A. No.”). See also Deposition of Aram Sinnreich (Sept. 25,2002),  id.,  at 390 (testimony about the band Wilco based on “[t]he press and industry news groups and scuttlebutt.”). These declarations do not support summary judgment in the face of evidence, proffered by MGM, of overwhelming use of Grokster’s and StreamCast’s software for infringement. 3  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",

Supp. 2d, at 1035 . This conclusion appears to rest almost entirely on the collection of declarations submitted by Grok-ster and StreamCast.  Ibid.   Review of these declarations reveals mostly anecdotal evidence, sometimes obtained secondhand, of authorized copyrighted works or public domain works available online and shared through peer-to-peer networks, and general statements about the benefits of peer-to-peer technology. See,  e. g.,  Decl. of Janis Ian ¶ 13, App. 128 (“P2P technologies offer musicians an alternative channel for promotion and distribution.”); Decl. of Gregory Newby ¶ 12,  id.,  at 136 (“Numerous authorized and public domain Project Gutenberg eBooks are made available on Morpheus, Kazaa, Gnutella, Grokster, and similar software products.”); Decl. of Aram Sinnreich ¶6,  id.,  at 151 (“file sharing seems to have a net positive impact on music sales”); Decl. of John Busher ¶ 8,  id.,  at 166 (“I estimate that Acous-tica generates sales of between $1,000 and $10,000 per month as a result of the distribution of its trialware software through the Gnutella and FastTrack Networks.”); Decl. of Patricia D. Hoekman ¶¶3-4,  id.,  at 169-170 (search on Morpheus for “President Bush speeches” found several video recordings, searches for “Declaration of Independence” and “Bible” found various documents and declarant was able to download a copy of the Declaration); Decl. of Sean L. Mayers ¶ 11,  id.,  at 67 (“Existing open, decentralized peer-to-peer file-sharing networks ... offer content owners distinct business advantages over alternate online distribution technologies.”). Compare Decl. of Brewster Kahle ¶ 20,  id.,  at 142 (“Those who download the Prelinger films . . . are entitled to redistribute those files, and the Archive welcomes their redistribution by the Morpheus-Grokster-KaZaa community of users.”), with Deposition of Brewster Kahle (Sept. 18,  *947 2002),  id.,  at 396-403 (testifying that he has no knowledge of any person downloading a Prelinger film using Morpheus, Grokster, or KaZaA). Compare also Decl. of Richard Prelin-ger ¶ 17,  id.,  at 147 (“[W]e welcome further redistribution of the Prelinger films ... by individuals using peer-to-peer software products like Morpheus, KaZaA and Grokster.”)) with Deposition of Richard Prelinger (Oct. 1, 2002),  id.,  at 410-411 (“Q. What is your understanding of Grokster? A. I have no understanding of Grokster. ... Q. Do you know whether any user of the Grokster software has made available to share any Prelinger film? A. No.”). See also Deposition of Aram Sinnreich (Sept. 25,2002),  id.,  at 390 (testimony about the band Wilco based on “[t]he press and industry news groups and scuttlebutt.”). These declarations do not support summary judgment in the face of evidence, proffered by MGM, of overwhelming use of Grokster’s and StreamCast’s software for infringement. 3  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",

Grokster, Ltd., 545 U.S. 913 (U.S. 2005)                                         | *948 Even if the absolute number of noninfringing files copied using the Grokster and StreamCast software is large, it does not follow that the products are therefore put to substantial noninfringing uses and are thus immune from liability. The number of noninfringing copies may be reflective of, and dwarfed by, the huge total volume of files shared. Further, the District Court and the Court of Appeals did not sharply distinguish between uses of Grokster’s and StreamCast’s software products (which this case is about) and uses of peer-to-peer technology generally (which this case is not about). *948 In sum, when the record in this case was developed, there was evidence that Grokster’s and StreamCast’s products were, and had been for some time, overwhelmingly used to infringe,  ante,  at 922-924; App. 434-489, 476-481, and that this infringement was the overwhelming source of revenue from the products,  ante,  at 925-926;  259 F. Supp. 2d, at 1043-1044 . Fairly appraised, the evidence was insufficient to demonstrate, beyond genuine debate, a reasonable prospect that substantial or commercially significant noninfringing uses were likely to develop over time.

Ante,  at 919. I further agree that, in light of our holding today, we need not now “revisit”  Sony Corp. of America  v.  Universal City Studios, Inc.,  464 U. S. 417  (1984).  Ante,  at 934. Other Members of the Court, however, take up the  Sony  question: whether Grokster’s product is “capable of ‘substantial’ or ‘commercially significant’ noninfringing uses.”  Ante,  at 942 (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (quoting  Sony,  supra,  at 442 ). And they answer that question by stating that the Court of Appeals was wrong when it granted summary judgment on the issue in Grokster’s favor.  Ante,  at 944. I write to explain why I disagree with them on this matter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",

In  Sony,  the Court considered the potential copyright liability of a company that did not itself illegally copy protected material, but rather sold a machine — a videocassette recorder (VCR) — that could be used to do so. A buyer could use that machine for  non-infringing  purposes, such as recording for later viewing (sometimes called “‘time-shifting,’”  Sony,  464 U. S., at 421 ) uncopyrighted television programs or copyrighted programs with a copyright holder’s permission. The buyer could use  *950 the machine for infringing purposes as well, such as building libraries of taped copyrighted programs. Or, the buyer might use the machine to record copyrighted programs under circumstances in which the legal status of the act of recording was uncertain  (i. e.,  where the copying may, or may not, have constituted a “fair use,”  id.,  at 425-426 ). Sony knew many customers would use its VCRs to engage in unauthorized copying and “‘library-building.’”  Id.,  at 458-459  (Blackmun, J., dissenting). But that fact, said the Court, was insufficient to make Sony itself an infringer. And the Court ultimately held that Sony was not liable for its customers’ acts of infringement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",

It pointed to patent law’s “staple article of commerce” doctrine,  ibid.,  under which a distributor of a product is not liable for patent infringement by its customers unless that product is “unsuited for any commercial noninfringing use.”  Dawson Chemical Co.  v.  Rohm & Haas Co.,  448 U. S. 176 , 198 (1980). The Court wrote that the sale of copying equipment, “like the sale of other articles of commerce, does not constitute contributory infringement if the product is widely used for legitimate, unobjectionable purposes.  Indeed, it need merely be capable of substantial noninfringing uses.” Sony,  464 U. S., at 442  (emphasis added). The Court ultimately characterized the legal “question” in the particular case as “whether [Sony’s VCR] is  capable of commercially significant noninfringing  uses” (while declining to give “precise content” to these terms).

The Court had before it a survey (commissioned by the District Court and then prepared by the respondents) showing that roughly 9% of all  *951 VCR recordings were of the type — namely, religious, educational, and sports programming — owned by producers and distributors testifying on Sony’s behalf who did not object to time-shifting. See Brief for Respondents, O. T. 1983, No. 81-1687, pp. 52-53; see also  Sony,  supra,  at 424  (7.3% of all Sony VCR use is to record sports programs; representatives of the sports leagues do not object). A much higher percentage of VCR  users  had at one point taped an authorized program, in addition to taping unauthorized programs. And the plaintiffs — not a large class of content providers as in this case — owned only a small percentage of the total available ^authorized programming. See  ante,  at 947, n. 3 (Ginsburg, J., concurring). But of all the taping actually done by Sony’s customers, only around 9% was of the sort the Court referred to as authorized.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",

That leaves some number of files near 10% that apparently are nonin-fringing, a figure very similar to the 9% or so of authorized time-shifting uses of the VCR that the Court faced in  Sony.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",

At least, MGM has offered no evidence sufficient to survive summary judgment that could plausibly demonstrate a significant quantitative difference. See  ante,  at 922 (opinion of the Court); see also Brief for Motion Picture Studio and Recording Company Petitioners i (referring to “at least 90% of the total use of the services”); but see  ante,  at 947, n. 3 (Ginsburg, J., concurring). To be sure, in quantitative terms these uses account for only a small percentage of the total number of uses of Grokster’s product. But the same was true in  Sony,  which characterized the relatively limited authorized copying market as “substantial.” (The Court made clear as well in  Sony  that the amount of material then presently available for lawful copying — if not actually copied— was significant, see  464 U. S., at 444 , and the same is certainly true in this case.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",

Its language and analysis suggest that a figure like 10%, if fixed for all time, might well prove insufficient, but that such a figure serves as an adequate foundation where there is a reasonable prospect of expanded legitimate uses over time.

And its language also indi *954 cates the appropriateness of looking to potential future uses of the product to determine its “capability.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",

But the foreseeable development of such uses, when taken together with an estimated 10% noninfringing material, is sufficient to meet  Sony’s  standard. And while  Sony  considered the record following a trial, there are no facts asserted by MGM in its summary judgment filings that lead me to believe the outcome after a trial here could be any different. The lower courts reached the same conclusion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",

And Grokster’s desires in this respect are beside the point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",

As I have interpreted the standard set forth in that case, it does. And of the Courts of Appeals that have considered the matter, only one has proposed interpreting  Sony  more strictly than I would do — in a case where the product might have failed under  any  standard.

Thus, to determine whether modification, or a strict interpretation, of  Sony  is needed, I would ask whether MGM has shown that  Sony  incorrectly balanced copyright and new-technology interests. In particular: (1) Has  Sony  (as I interpret it) worked to protect new technology? (2) If so, would modification or strict interpretation significantly weaken that protection? (3) If  *957 so, would new or necessary copyright-related benefits outweigh any such weakening?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",

At the same time, it helps deter them from distributing products that have no other real function than — or that are specifically intended for — copyright infringement, deterrence that the Court’s holding today reinforces (by adding a weapon to the copyright holder’s legal arsenal).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",

The rule deliberately makes it difficult for courts to find secondary liability where new technology is at issue. It establishes that the law will not impose copyright liability upon the distributors of dual-use technologies (who do not themselves engage in unauthorized copying) unless the product in question will be used  almost exclusively  to infringe copyrights (or unless they actively induce infringements as we today describe).  Sony  thereby recognizes that the copyright laws are not intended to discourage or to control the emergence of new technologies, including (perhaps especially) those that help disseminate information and ideas more broadly or more efficiently. Thus  Sony’s  rule shelters VCRs, typewriters, tape recorders, photocopiers, computers, cassette players, compact disc burners, digital video recorders, MP3 players, Internet search engines, and peer-to-peer software. But  Sony’s  rule does not shelter descramblers, even if one could  theoretically  use a descrambler in a noninfringing way.  464  *958 U. S., at 441-442 .

It does not confine its scope to a static snapshot of a product’s current uses (thereby threatening technologies that have undeveloped future markets). Eather, as the VCR example makes clear, a product’s market can evolve dramatically over time. And  Sony  — by referring to a  capacity  for substantial noninfring-ing uses — recognizes that fact.  Sony’s  word “capable” refers to a plausible, not simply a theoretical, likelihood that such uses will come to pass, and that fact anchors  Sony  in practical reality. Cf.

Judges have no specialized technical ability to answer questions about present or future technological feasibilility or commercial viability where technology professionals, engineers, and venture capitalists themselves may radically disagree and where answers may differ depending upon whether one focuses upon the time of product development or the time of distribution. Consider, for example, the question whether devices can be added to Grokster’s software that will filter out infringing files. MGM tells us this is easy enough to do, as do several  amici  that produce and sell the filtering technology. See,  e. g.,  Brief for Motion Picture Studio and Recording Company Petitioners 11; Brief for Audible Magic Corp. et al. as  Amici Curiae  3-10. Grokster says it is not at all easy to do, and not an efficient solution in any event, and several apparently disinterested computer science professors agree. See Brief for Respondents 31; Brief for Computer Science Professor Harold Abelson et al. as  Amici Curias  6-10, 14-18. Which account should a judge credit?

Justice Ginsbubg’s approach would require defendants to produce considerably more concrete evidence — more than was presented here — to earn  Sony’s  shelter. That heavier evidentiary demand, and especially the more dramatic (case-by-case balancing) modifications that MGM and the Government seek, would, I believe, undercut the protection that  Sony  now offers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",

But it would simultaneously increase the legal uncertainty that surrounds the creation or development of a new technology capable of being put to infringing uses. Inventors and entrepreneurs (in the garage, the dorm room, the corporate lab, or the boardroom) would have to fear (and in many cases endure) costly and extensive trials when they create, produce, or distribute the sort of information technology that can be used for copyright infringement. They would often be left guessing as to how a court, upon later review of the product and its uses, would decide when necessarily rough estimates amounted to sufficient evidence. They would have no way to predict how courts would weigh the respec *960 tive values of infringing and noninfringing uses; determine the efficiency and advisability of technological changes; or assess a product’s potential future markets. The price of a wrong guess — even if it involves a good-faith effort to assess technical and commercial viability — could be large statutory damages (not less than $750 and up to $30,000  per infringed work).  17 U.

But it is harder to conclude that the gains on the copyright swings would exceed the losses on the technology roundabouts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",

As  Sony  itself makes clear, the producer of a technology which  permits  unlawful copying does not himself  engage  in unlawful copying — a fact that makes the attachment of copyright liability to the creation, production, or distribution of the technology an exceptional thing. See  464 U. S., at 431  (courts “must be circumspect” in construing the copyright laws to preclude distribution of new technologies). Moreover,  Sony  has been the law for some time. And that fact imposes a serious burden upon copyright holders like MGM to show a need for change in the current rules of the game, including a more strict interpretation of the test. See,  e.g.,  Brief for Motion Picture Studio and Recording Company Petitioners 31  (Sony  should not protect products when the “primary or principal” use is infringing).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",

To say  *961 this is not to doubt the basic need to protect copyrighted material from infringement. The Constitution itself stresses the vital role that copyright plays in advancing the “useful Arts.” Art. I, §8, cl. 8. No one disputes that “reward to the author or artist serves to induce release to the public of the products of his creative genius.”  United States  v.  Paramount Pictures, Inc.,  334 U. S. 131 , 158 (1948). And deliberate unlawful copying is no less an unlawful taking of property than garden-variety theft. See,  e. g.,  18 U. S. C. §2319  (2000 ed. and Supp. II) (criminal copyright infringement); § 1961(1)(B) (2000 ed., Supp. II) (copyright infringement can be a predicate act under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act); § 1956(c)(7)(D) (2000 ed., Supp. II) (money laundering includes the receipt of proceeds from copyright infringement). But these highly general principles cannot by themselves tell us how to balance the interests at issue in  Sony  or whether  Sony’s  standard needs modification. And at certain key points, information is lacking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",

Since copyright’s basic objective is creation and its revenue objectives but a means to that end, this is the underlying copyright question. See  Twentieth Century Music Corp.  v.  Aiken,  422 U. S. 151 , 156 (1975) (“Creative work is to be encouraged and rewarded, but private motivation must ultimately serve the cause of promoting broad public availability of literature, music, and the other arts”). And its answer is far from clear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",

Services like Grokster may well be liable under an inducement theory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",

Indeed, since September 2003, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) has filed “thousands of suits against people for sharing copyrighted material.” Walker, New Movement Hits Universities: Get Legal Music, Washington Post, Mar. 17, 2005, p. El. These suits have provided copyright holders with damages; have served as a teaching tool, making clear that much file sharing, if done without permission, is unlawful; and apparently have had a real and significant deterrent effect. See,  e. g.,  L. Rainie, M. Madden, D. Hess, & G. Mudd, Pew Internet Project and comScore Media Metrix Data Memo: The state of music downloading and file-sharing online 2,4, 6,10 (Apr. 2004), http://www.pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP_Filesharing_ April_04.pdf (number of people downloading files fell from a peak of roughly 35 million to roughly 23 million in the year following the first suits; 38% of current downloaders report downloading fewer files because of the suits); M. Madden & L. Rainie, Pew Internet Project Data Memo: Music and video downloading moves beyond P2P, p. 7 (Mar. 2005), http://www. pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP_Filesharing_March05.pdf (number of downloaders has “inched up” but “continues to rest well below the peak level”); Note, Costs and Benefits of the Recording Industry’s Litigation Against Individuals,  20 Berkeley Tech.

Several services now sell music for less than $1 per song. (Walmart.com, for example, charges $0.88 each.) Consequently, many consumers initially attracted to the convenience and flexibility of services like Grokster are now migrating to lawful paid services (services with copying permission) where they can enjoy at little cost even greater convenience and flexibility without engaging in unlawful swapping.

Supp. 2d 966 (C.D. Cal. 2006)                             | I. INTRODUCTION In October 2001, Plaintiffs—a group of record companies, movie studios, and music publishers—filed a single-count complaint against Defendants Grokster Ltd, (“Grokster”), Consumer Empowerment BV, and the corporate predecessors of StreamCast Networks, Inc. (“Stream-Cast”). The complaint alleged that Defendants’ file-sharing software contributed to massive infringement of copyrighted works owned by Plaintiffs. On July 12, 2002,  *971 Plaintiffs filed the first amended complaint, which dropped Consumer Empowerment BV, replaced StreamCast’s corporate predecessors with StreamCast, and also joined a host of Defendants associated with the Kazaa file-sharing network, most notably Sharman Networks (“Sharman”). *971 On April 25, 2003, the Court granted summary judgment for Defendants StreamCast and Grokster, and denied Plaintiffs’ motions for summary judgment.  Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.,  259 F.Supp.2d 1029  (C.D.Cal.2003). Because Plaintiffs sought primarily injunctive relief, the Court considered only the then-current versions of Defendants’ software, and did not address Grokster and StreamCast’s alleged liability for past versions of their software or services. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the Court’s ruling in August 2004.  Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.,  380 F.3d 1154  (9th Cir.2004). The' Supreme Court unanimously reversed the, grant of summary judgment for Grokster and StreamCast in a decision issued on June 27, 2005.  Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.,  545 U.S. 913 ,  125 S.Ct. 2764 ,  162 L.Ed.2d 781  (2005) (hereinafter  “Grokster”).  The Supreme Court remanded the case for renewed consideration of Plaintiffs’ motions for summary judgment.  Id.  at 2782. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, Inc. v.

The Court knows of no rule in copyright, and StreamCast has cited no authority for the proposition, that a copyright holder is bound to pursue either all infringers or none at all. The waiver analysis should ordinarily be limited to evaluating the conduct and/or communications that occur between a plaintiff and a defendant claiming the waiver defense. StreamCast’s position would create a rule whereby Plaintiffs would be barred from suing any of the millions upon millions of direct infringers utilizing peer-to-peer networks unless all were sued. Even assuming that Stream-Cast correctly describes Plaintiffs’ arrangement with other file sharing companies, it is of no moment. *1225 StreamCast further raises the estoppel argument, based again upon the same two grounds discussed immediately above: (1) Plaintiffs’ refusal to assist StreamCast, and (2) Plaintiffs’ dealings with iMesh and others. The elements of estoppel in copyright cases were established by the Ninth Circuit in  Hampton v. Paramount Pictures Corp.,  279 F.2d 100  (9th Cir.1960):  Id.  at 105 . StreamCast has failed to even identify this test, let alone demonstrate that it has evidence supporting each factor. While Plaintiffs are undisputedly aware of StreamCast’s infringing conduct, the remaining elements find no support in the record. There is no evidence suggesting that Plaintiffs intended or acted in a manner that would allow StreamCast to believe that it could induce infringement. 23  The Court is also unaware of any “true facts” of which StreamCast was ignorant, or how StreamCast was injured through detrimental reliance on Plaintiffs’ conduct. Thus, the estoppel argument is rejected. Hampton v.

Supp. 2d 1197 (C.D. Cal. 2007)                           | 31 An injunction in this form will not issue. Plaintiffs’ copyrights generally do not afford them the  right to decide whether  a staple should or should not be distributed. 32  Furthermore, this Court also has doubts that an immediate shutdown order would most effectively stop further infringement. In its 2003 Order, the Court discussed the undisputed nature of StreamCast’s peer-to-peer network: “If ... [StreamCast] closed [its] doors and deactivated all computers within [its] control, users of their products could continue sharing files with little or no interruption.”  Grokster,  259 F.Supp.2d at 1041 . If StreamCast were prohibited from distributing or operating Morpheus, including a version with a filtering mechanism, end-users will continue to infringe. It is likely more beneficial to Plaintiffs’ rights if StreamCast were allowed to distribute filtering software and to take steps to encourage end-users into accepting an upgrade. right to decide whether  32 Grokster,  259 F.Supp.2d at 1041 In any event, the Court will follow a third path. A permanent injunction will issue requiring StreamCast to reduce Morpheus’s infringing capabilities, while preserving its core noninfringing functionality, 33  as effectively as possible. 34  StreamCast’s duties will include, but not necessarily be limited to: (1) a filter as part of future Morpheus software distributed to the public; and (2) steps to encourage end-user upgrades from non-filtered legacy software. Such duties represent the proper balance between competing interests. Plaintiffs’ copyrights can be protected to the extent feasible, but Morpheus’s noninfringing uses will not be completely enjoined.  Cf. Transocean Offshore Deepwater Drilling, Inc. v.
